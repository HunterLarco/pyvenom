# VENOM INDEXES

# This search.yaml is automatically updated whenever the venom framework
# detects a schema change. If you want to manage the search.yaml file
# manually, remove the above marker line (the line saying "# VENOM INDEXES").
# If you want to manage some indexes manually, move them above the marker line.
# The search.yaml file is automatically uploaded to the admin console when
# you next deploy your application using appcfg.py.
